- read_midi.py: np array of velocities; squished
- then numpy array to character representation
- LSTM model: start with transfer learning?







NEW plans
- filter out training examples with too many identical columns (i.e. long presses) b/c it might interfere w/ training
    - set another threshold value for this length
- change threshold value: or assign velocity in proportion to the output values, rather than just a constant value for all pressed notes
- baroque music?
- if the dataset contains slow music, use 8th-note base instead of 16th note?
- back to text generation: not necessarily the text generation format, but the idea of using the list of pressed notes, rather than 0/1s
